# Project 4 - *Twitter Redux*

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Hamburger menu
   - [X] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
   - [X] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
   - [X] The menu can look similar to the example or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
- [X] Profile page
   - [X] Contains the user header view
   - [X] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [X] Home Timeline
   - [X] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Profile Page
   - [X] Implement the paging view for the user description.
   - [X] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
   - [X] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
   - [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
   - [ ] Tap account to switch to
   - [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
   - [ ] Swipe to delete an account


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Custom hamburger menu including current user info.
- [X] Code reuse, the same cell design in three different view controllers

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

  1. Navigation and view controllers stack.
  2. Autolayout size classes.

## Notes

It took me a while to understand content view controller and the correct way of switching to different views.
Did not have time to finish refactoring the code and remove some code duplication.
